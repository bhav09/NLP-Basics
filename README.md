# NLP_basics


This repository consists of all the necessary codes , basic theory and resources for anyone to start from scratch and study !
To practice all this , I would recommend spyder IDE for the same because it will notify you via error for any package that you won't be having of nltk.


To download all the packages of nltk type this in the command prompt: 

import nltk

nltk.download()


(make sure to have a python environment running on your cmd for the same)
