Natural Language Processing & Sentiment Analysis

What's in a review? Is it positive or negative? Yelp's reviews contain a lot of metadata that can be mined and used to infer meaning, business attributes, and sentiment.

## Graph Mining

We recently launched our Local Graph but can you take the graph further? How do user's relationships define their usage patterns? Where are the trend setters eating before it becomes popular?
